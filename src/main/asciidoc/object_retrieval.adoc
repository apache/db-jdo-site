== Object Retrievalanchor:Object_Retrieval[]

JDO provides persistence of objects. The logical next step after
persisting objects is to retrieve them for use in your application.
There are several ways to do this

=== Retrieve an object from its identityanchor:Retrieve_an_object_from_its_identity[]

The simplest form of object retrieval is where we have the identity.
This is simply

....
Object obj = pm.getObjectById(identity);
                
....

If the object is in the JDO cache then it is retrieved from there,
otherwise the JDO implementation goes to the datastore. When the object
is retrieved its fields are populated according to its Fetch Group.

=== Retrieve an object based on its Extentanchor:Retrieve_an_object_based_on_its_Extent[]

A persistable class can be persisted with an *Extent* of all instances
of that type. You can use this to retrieve objects of the required type,
like this

....
Extent ex = pm.getExtent(MyClass.class, true);
Iterator iter = ex.iterator();
while (iter.hasNext())
{
    MyClass obj = (MyClass)iter.next();
    ...
}
....

The second argument in the _getExtent_ call is whether to include
instances of subclasses.

=== Retrieve an object based on a criteriaanchor:Retrieve_an_object_based_on_a_criteria[]

Where we want to retrieve all objects based on some criteria (e.g all
objects of class A where field 'x' of A is a certain value) we need to
use a query language. JDO2 provides 2 options here. JDOQL is
object-based and allows you to express your query in terms of the
classes and fields you are using. SQL is datastore-based and allows you
to express your query in terms of the datastore tables and columns.

To give an example of a JDOQL query

....
Query q = pm.newQuery(MyClass.class, "field1 < value");
q.declareParameters("int value");
List results = q.execute(205);
Iterator iter = results.iterator();
while (iter.hasNext())
{
    MyClass obj = (MyClass)iter.next();
}
....

If the objects found by the query are in the JDO cache then they are
retrieved from there, otherwise the JDO implementation goes to the
datastore. When the objects are retrieved their fields are populated
according to the Fetch Group.
