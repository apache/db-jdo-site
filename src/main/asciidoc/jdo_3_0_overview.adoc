=== JDO 3.0 Overviewanchor:JDO_3.0_Overview[]

==== Backgroundanchor:Background[]

Java Data Objects (JDO) is a specification begun in 2000, with 2 major
releases JDO1 (2002 under JSR0012) and JDO2 (2006 under JSR0243). It was
placed under Apache in 2005 and is the rare example of a specification
that has undergone continual improvement during its lifetime, for the
last 4 years being developed totally in the open, accepting input from
everyone.

JDO 3.0 was started in October 2008, and encompasses additions to the
specification in the areas of a metadata API, an enhancer API, addition
of cancel/timeout control to queries, and addition of control to the
locking of objects when read.

==== Metadata APIanchor:Metadata_API[]

To persist Java objects you need to specify which classes are
persistable, and how they are persisted. This was traditionally handled
using XML configuration. With the advent of JDK1.5, annotations were
added as another possible way of defining such information. JDO 3.0
takes this further and provides a *Metadata API*, allowing runtime
definition. This is of particular use for systems that don't know at
application startup which classes should be persistable, maybe because
the class hasn't been written yet.

To demonstrate the Metadata API, lets assume that we have a
PersistenceManagerFactory created for our datastore. So we request a new
Metadata object.

....
PersistenceManagerFactory pmf = JDOHelper.getPersistenceManagerFactory(props);
JDOMetaData jdomd = pmf.newMetadata();
....

So we can now start defining the metadata for the package/class(es) we
want to persist. The Metadata is structured in a similar way to the XML
DTD/XSD. So let's add a class

....
ClassMetadata cmd = jdomd.newClassMetadata("test.Client");
cmd.setTable("CLIENT").setDetachable(true).setIdentityType(javax.jdo.annotations.IdentityType.DATASTORE);
cmd.setPersistenceModifier(javax.jdo.metadata.ClassPersistenceModifier.PERSISTENCE_CAPABLE);
....

So we have a class _test.Client_ using datastore-identity, that is
detachable, and is persisted to a table _CLIENT_. As you can see, you
can chain setters for convenient coding.

....
InheritanceMetadata inhmd = cmd.newInheritanceMetadata();
inhmd.setStrategy(javax.jdo.annotations.InheritanceStrategy.NEW_TABLE);
DiscriminatorMetadata dmd = inhmd.newDiscriminatorMetadata();
dmd.setColumn("disc").setValue("Client").setStrategy(javax.jdo.annotations.DiscriminatorStrategy.VALUE_MAP);
dmd.setIndexed(Indexed.TRUE);

VersionMetadata vermd = cmd.newVersionMetadata();
vermd.setStrategy(javax.jdo.annotations.VersionStrategy.VERSION_NUMBER).setColumn("version");
vermd.setIndexed(Indexed.TRUE);
....

So we will use "new-table" inheritance for this class, and it will have
a discriminator stored in column _disc_ of type "value-map". The class
will also be versioned, using column _version_, that is indexed. All of
this was for the class as a whole, so let's look at the
fields/properties of the class.

....
FieldMetadata fmd = cmd.newFieldMetadata("name");
fmd.setNullValue(javax.jdo.annotations.NullValue.DEFAULT).setColumn("name").setIndexed(true).setUnique(true);
....

So we have a field _name_ that is persisted into column _name_, and is
unique and indexed. The API metadata components all follow the DTD as
stated earlier, so if our field was a collection we could then define
_CollectionMetadata_ below it.

The only thing left to do is register the metadata with the
PersistenceManagerFactory, like this

....
pmf.registerMetadata(jdomd);
....

and any contact with the class will now persist according to this API.

You can similarly browse already registered metadata using

....
ComponentMetadata compmd = pmf.getMetadata("mydomain.MyClass");
....

Note that you cannot change already registered metadata with JDO 3.0.

You can view the Javadocs for the Metadata API
http://db.apache.org/jdo/api30/apidocs/javax/jdo/metadata/package-summary.adoc[here].

==== Enhancer APIanchor:Enhancer_API[]

JDO implementations typically (but aren't compelled to) include a
bytecode enhancement step, allowing for efficient change detection of
objects. While the Metadata API above is very useful, if we just define
metadata for a class we still need to enhance the class using this
metadata. This is where the *Enhancer API* comes in. To start we need to
get a JDOEnhancer

....
JDOEnhancer enhancer = JDOHelper.getEnhancer();
....

and now that we have the enhancer and want to enhance our class above so
we need to register our new metadata with it (generate the metadata as
shown above)

....
enhancer.registerMetadata(jdomd);
....

Now we can handle the enhancement using a separate class loader if
required (for example if the classes were defined dynamically, e.g by
ASM)

....
enhancer.setClassLoader(myClassLoader);
....

Finally we select what to enhance, and perform the enhancement

....
String[] classes = {"test.Client"};
enhancer.addClasses(classes);
enhancer.enhance();
....

So the class is now enhanced and is ready for use.

You can view the Javadocs for the Enhancer API
http://db.apache.org/jdo/api30/apidocs/index.adoc[here].

==== Query Cancel/Timeout APIanchor:Query_CancelTimeout_API[]

On occasions a query may be inefficient, or may suffer from problems in
the underlying datastore, and so we don't want to affect the
application. In this case it would make sense to have control over a
timeout for the query, or be able to cancel it. JDO 3.0 introduces the
Query cancel/timeout control, via the following new methods to
_javax.jdo.Query_

....
void setTimeoutMillis(Integer interval);
Integer getTimeoutMillis();
void cancelAll();
void cancel(Thread thread);
....

So we have the ability to cancel a query as required, or just let it
timeout.

==== Control of read objects lockinganchor:Control_of_read_objects_locking[]

When we are using datastore (pessimistic) transactions it often doesn't
make sense to just lock all objects read in the transaction. For this
reason JDO 3.0 introduces control over which objects are locked and
which aren't.

In metadata for each class you can specify the "serialize-read" setting.
True will mean that objects of this type will be locked when read.

On a Transaction you can override the metadata settings via the
following method

....
void setSerializeRead(Boolean serialize);
Boolean getSerializeRead();
....

On a Query you can override the metadata and Transaction settings via
the following method

....
void setSerializeRead(Boolean serialize);
Boolean getSerializeRead();
....

This concludes our simple overview of JDO3. We hope you enjoy using it
