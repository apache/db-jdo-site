== Meta-Data - ORManchor:Meta-Data_-_ORM[]

JDO defines XML MetaData in *jdo* files as well as *orm* files. As
always with XML, the metadata must match the defined DTD/XSD for that
file type. This section describes the content of the *orm* files. The
content of *jdo* files can be found xref:jdo_dtd.adoc[here]. All *orm*
files must contain a valid DTD/DOCTYPE specification. You can use PUBLIC
or SYSTEM versions of these.

Here are a couple of examples valid for *orm* files with DTD
specification

....
<!DOCTYPE orm PUBLIC
    "-//The Apache Software Foundation//DTD Java Data Objects Mapping Metadata 3.2//EN"
    "https://db.apache.org/jdo/xmlns/orm_3_2.dtd">
....

or

....
<!DOCTYPE orm SYSTEM "file:/javax/jdo/orm.dtd">
....

{empty} +


Here is an example valid for *orm* files with XSD specification

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<orm xmlns="https://db.apache.org/jdo/xmlns/orm"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="https://db.apache.org/jdo/xmlns/orm https://db.apache.org/jdo/xmlns/orm_3_2.xsd" version="3.2">
    ...
</orm>
....

Your MetaData should match either the
https://db.apache.org/jdo/xmlns/orm_3_2.dtd[DTD] or the
https://db.apache.org/jdo/xmlns/orm_3_2.xsd[XSD] specification.
