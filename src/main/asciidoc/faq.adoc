*What is JDO?* JDO is Java Data Objects, a datastore-agnostic interface
for storing Java objects in transactional datastores.

*I'd like to find out more about the project and possibly contribute.
What do I do next?* Participation on the project is via the mailing list
and the source code repository. You join by subscribing to the mailing
list and participating in discussions. You can help by contributing your
ideas, enthusiasm, code, documentation, and tests. The fundamental tenet
of the Apache Software Foundation is that great communities build great
code. The emphasis is on community; the code comes from that. If you
want to help, just join the mailing list, see what needs to be done, and
do it. Welcome!

*Where is the mailing list, and how can I subscribe?* The developers
mailing list is jdo-dev@db.apache.org, a high-volume list currently
receiving from 100 to 300 messages a month. +
The users mailing list is jdo-user@db.apache.org.

*Does this project use a wiki?* It does - the

on the mailing list and provides additional information on the project.
