== Why JDO ?anchor:Why_JDO_[]

The majority of applications need to persist (or store) data during
their lifecycle. There are many ways of doing this with an application
written in Java.

* If your datastore is RDBMS you can handle the persistence (and
retrieval) of data yourself using *JDBC*. Obviously with this route you
have the burden of having to write the persistence layer yourself. This
gives much control, but also creates significant work, both in writing
the code but also in testing and maintenance.
* You can use *JDO*, a standardised persistence API. With *JDO* you can
develop plain old java objects (POJOs) and persist them as they are
transparently. This requires very little work from the developer. It
allows persistence to any type of datastore in principle, being designed
with flexibility and datastore agnositicity in mind. This has been a
standard since 2002 (JDO1), being upgraded in 2006 (JDO2) and is in the
process of being developed further (JDO2.1) by Apache JDO
* You can use *JPA*, a standardised persistence API, and part of the
EJB3 specification. This also allows you to to develop plain old Java
objects (POJOs) and persist them using a standardised API. It's
specification is not as mature or as feature rich as the JDO API, nor
does it provide the flexibility of using any type of datastore. This was
released in 2006 (JPA1) to supercede EJB2. It really only allows
persistence to RDBMS datastores. If you want to persist to other
datastores you should consider JDO.
* _If you are stuck with using an EJB2.* architecture you could use
Entity Beans. This means that you hand off your objects to the EJB part
of the J2EE server. This simplifies things for the developer in some
respect but places major restrictions in that your objects have to be
Entity Beans._
* You can also use a proprietary persistence API (e.g Hibernates own
API, TopLinks own API, iBatis, Castor etc). The disadvantages of going
this route are that you cannot easily swap to an alternative
implementation of the API if you hit problems with your software choice.

To give a _guide_, here are a few important consideration points when
choosing a persistence layer for your application.

[arabic]
. refers to whether it is necessary to write the persistence yourself
(e.g as with JDBC) or whether you can just persist by simple calls.
. requires the developer to write this layer.
