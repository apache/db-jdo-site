=== About Apache JDOanchor:About_Apache_JDO[]

Welcome to Apache JDO, a project of the http://db.apache.org/[Apache DB
project]. Our goal is a thriving community of users and developers of
object persistence technology.

Java Data Objects (JDO) is a standard way to access persistent data in
databases, using plain old Java objects (POJO) to represent persistent
data. The approach separates data manipulation (done by accessing Java
data members in the Java domain objects) from database manipulation
(done by calling the JDO interface methods). This separation of concerns
leads to a high degree of independence of the Java view of data from the
database view of the data.

Interfaces are defined for the user's view of persistence:

* PersistenceManager: the component responsible for the life cycle of
persistent instances, Query factory, and Transaction access
* Query: the component responsible for querying the datastore and
returning persistent instances or values
* Transaction: the component responsible for initiating and completing
transactions

JDO is being developed as a Java Specification Request in the Java
Community Process. The original JDO 1.0 is
http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=12[JSR-12] and the current JDO 3.0.1
is http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=243[JSR-243].

The Apache JDO project is focused on building the JDO API and the TCK
for compatibility testing of JDO implementations. Commercial and open
source implementations of JDO are available for relational databases,
object databases, and file systems. If you need an implementation for
building a JDO application, see link:impls.adoc[Implementations].
