The JDO project uses
http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10630[JIRA]
to track issues.

We use the following workflow for our JIRA issues:

____
Open->Resolved(<->Reopened)->Closed
____

____
When the engineer has fixed an issue, she sets the issue to resolved.
The submitter can reopen it if there is some problem with it. When the
release in which the issue is fixed ships, the issue is set to closed.
____

____
If the same issue comes up again after release, another JIRA is opened,
referring to the original issue. This accommodates fixes being
backported (if ever necessary) to dot releases after the original
release ships.
