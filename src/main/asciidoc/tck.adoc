=== About the Technology Compatibility Kitanchor:About_the_Technology_Compatibility_Kit[]

In order to demonstrate compliance with the Java Data Objects
specification, an implementation must pass all of the tests in the
Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK). The TCK is released as a packaged
Java source tree. Maven is the driver of a test run. You must download
and install http://maven.apache.org/[Maven 2+]before running the TCK.

examination by the public. The posting includes the output of the test
run, which consists of multiple log files containing configuration
