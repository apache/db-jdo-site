=== About JDO Releasesanchor:About_JDO_Releases[]

A release of JDO includes the JDO API and the Technology Compatibility
Kit (TCK). The TCK is available only in source form. The API project is
available as source and as a jar file using the standard Maven dependency protocol.

* The source release contains sources to build jdo-api.jar. The jar file is
the only artifact needed for users who wish to compile their programs
using the JDO API. It can be downloaded automatically by maven and
placed into the local maven repository if you include the proper
dependency in your maven project definition. Use groupId javax.jdo,
artifactId jdo-ap and version 3.2. Alternatively, it can be downloaded
manually from Maven and put into a location of your choice.
* The tck project contains the JDO Technology Compatibility Kit. The
source distribution is the only artifact needed to be downloaded by the
user.
