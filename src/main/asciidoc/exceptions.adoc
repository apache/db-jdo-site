=== JDO Exceptionsanchor:JDO_Exceptions[]

All exceptions raised by a JDO implementation are runtime exceptions
which means that you can choose to catch the exceptions or not. The
reason for JDO using _unchecked_ exceptions is that JDO tries to provide
transparent persistence, and so needs to present the same interface and
exceptions whatever the state an object has.

==== JDOExceptionanchor:JDOException[]

This is the base class for all JDO exceptions. It is a subclass of
RuntimeException, and need not be declared or caught.
