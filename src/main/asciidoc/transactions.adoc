=== Transactionsanchor:Transactions[]

When managing the persistence of objects using a
link:pm.adoc[PersistenceManager] it is normal to handle all datastore
operations in a transaction. For this reason each _PersistenceManager_
has its own transaction. Consequently a typical JDO persistence method
will look something like this

....
PersistenceManager pm = pmf.getPersistenceManager();
Transaction tx = pm.currentTransaction();
try
{
    tx.begin(); // Start the PM transaction

    ... perform some persistence operations

    tx.commit(); // Commit the PM transaction
}
finally
{
    if (tx.isActive())
    {
        tx.rollback(); // Error occurred so rollback the PM transaction
    }
}
....

JDO supports the two main forms of transaction

* Transactions can lock all records in a datastore and keep them locked
until they are ready to commit their changes. These are known as
Pessimistic (or datastore) Transactions
* Transactions can simply assume that things in the datastore will not
change until they are ready to commit, not lock any records and then
just before committing make a check for changes. These are known as
Optimistic Transactions.

You select the type of transaction to be used by a _PersistenceManager_
(PM) either by setting the PMF property *javax.jdo.option.Optimistic*,
or on the transaction you call

....
pm.currentTransaction().setOptimistic(true);
....
