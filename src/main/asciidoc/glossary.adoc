=== JDO Glossaryanchor:JDO_Glossary[]

JDO utilizes some terminology used elsewhere (e.g J2EE) but also
introduces some terminology that may be new to people. Below is a
glossary of some common terms that may be encountered.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Term |Definition
|anchor:application-identity[]####application identity |When the persistence
of a class is defined in a MetaData file, the developer can decide that
they want to control the identity of objects of that class. This is
called *application identity* because the application has the control.

|anchor:attach-detach[]####attach/detach |When you have an object of a class
that is associated with a PersistenceManager it is referred to as being
_attached_. If you want to stop persistence of that object you can
_detach_ the object. This has the effect that any changes to the object
will not be persisted, and also that the object can be used outside
transactions.

|anchor:datastore-identity[]####datastore identity |When the persistence of a
class is defined in a MetaData file, the developer can decide that they
want the identity of objects of that class to be defined by the JDO
implementation. This is called *datastore identity*

|anchor:default-fetch-group[]####default-fetch-group (DFG) |When a persisted
object is retrieved from the datastore its fields can be retrieved with
it, or optionally can be retrieved only when needed. If a field is in
the *default-fetch-group* it will be retrieved when the object is
retrieved. Some field types default to being in the
*default-fetch-group* (e.g primitives, wrappers to primtives,
java.util.Date) and others (e.g java.util.Set, java.util.List) don't.

|anchor:embedded[]####embedded |A field can be defined as embedded if it will
be stored as a column in the table of its containing object.

|anchor:enhancer[]####enhancer |JDO 1.0.1 requires the use of a byte-code
enhancer that takes the Java compiled classes and "enhances" them,
adding in information to permit their use in a JDO environment.

|anchor:fco[]####FCO |JDO defines 2 main groups of Java objects. The first is
those objects that have an identity. These are termed "First Class
Objects" or FCO for short.

|anchor:fetchgroup[]####Fetch Group |JDO allows a user to define groups of
fields that should be retrieved (fetched) at the same time. These are
called a "fetch group". The principal "fetch group" is the "default
fetch group", where JDO has rules for what fields are in this group. A
user can define their own group, and make this active so that when
objects of their type are retrieved, they have control over the fetching
process.

|anchor:JDOQL[]####JDOQL |JDO introduces its own Java-like query language as a
datastore independent way of retrieving objects from the datastore. This
is known as JDOQL (JDO Query Language).

|anchor:nondurable-identity[]####nondurable identity |Where the objects of a
class should be unique in the JVM but not in the datastore (where an
RDBMS table doesnt have a PK for example).

|anchor:objectid-class[]####objectid class |When an object of a class is
persisted, it is assigned an object identity. When the developer has
chosen to use xref:application-identity[application identity] they can
assign a class to represent this identity (as a primary key) - this is
the object id class.

|anchor:optimistic-transaction[]####optimistic transaction |When working with
long duration transactions it is undesirable to have locking and so the
assumption is made that the data being updated by the transaction will
not be modified by any other transaction during the course of the
(optimistic) transaction. The data is checked just before commit to
confirm integrity that no data has been changed. See also
xref:pessimistic-transaction[pessimistic transaction] for the contrary
type which provides locking.

|anchor:persistence-by-reachability[]####persistence-by-reachability |When you
call makePersistent() on an object, the object will be persisted and, in
addition, any other objects reachable from that object (via
relationships) will also be persisted. This is known as
*persistence-by-reachability*. This process is repeated at commit() time
when it checks whether these reachable objects are still reachable and,
if not, removes them from persistence.

|anchor:persistence-aware[]####persistence-aware |When an class needs to
access fields of a persistence capable class directly, it should be
enhanced, and is referred to as "Persistence Aware". If a class uses
field accessor methods then it doesnt need to become "Persistence
Aware".

|anchor:persistence-capable[]####persistence-capable (PC) |When an class is
byte-code enhanced, and has valid MetaData, it is referred to as
"Persistence Capable". This means that it can be persisted by a JDO
implementation.

|anchor:persistence-modifier[]####persistence-modifier |When defining the
persistence of a class, the developer can select particular fields to be
persisted, and others not depending on their importance in the scope of
their application. The *persistence-modifier* defines whether a field is
persistent. If this tag is not specified JDO will assign defaults based
on the field type (primitives, primitive wrappers, java.util.Data,
persistence capable fields, etc are by default persistent).

|anchor:persistent[]####persistent |This is an object state where the object
is persistent in a datastore.

|anchor:pessimistic-transaction[]####pessimistic transaction |This is the
default transaction type in JDO, and is suitable for shortlived
operations where there is no other blocking activity during the
transaction. When data is accessed other transactions are locked out
from accessing it until the transaction is complete. See also
xref:optimistic-transaction[optimistic transaction] for the contrary
type which reduces locking.

|anchor:requires-extent[]####Requires Extent |When the persistent of a class
is defined, the developer decides if the object will be stored with its
own identity (in its own table for example) or whether it will be stored
as part of another object. If it will have its own identity, it will
require and Extent.

|anchor:sco[]####SCO |JDO defines 2 main groups of Java objects. The second
group is those objects that don't have an identity. These are termed
"Second Class Objects" or SCO for short.

|anchor:SQL[]####SQL |JDO allows use of multiple query languages. One of
these, for use with RDBMS datastores, is SQL.

|anchor:transient[]####transient |This is an object state where the object is
not persistent.
