== JDO Extentsanchor:JDO_Extents[]

JDO implementations manage the persistence of objects into the
datastore. An *Extent* is a collection of objects of a particular type
of object that have been persisted. When you define the MetaData for a
class you can define if the class requires an Extent. The default is
true. You access the Extent as follows

....
Extent e = pm.getExtent(MyClass.class, true);
            
....

This example will return an Extent that contains all persisted instances
of the class _MyClass_ and its subclasses (the second argument in the
call). An Extent is useful where you want to restrict a Query to query
over just that set of objects. It can also be used where you just want
to retrieve all persisted objects of a type (as an alternative to using
a Query).
