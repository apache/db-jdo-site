= JDO 3.1 Distributionsanchor:JDO_3.1_Distributions[]

If you intend to develop JDO (make modifications to the JDO code), you should
clone the public repository and submit pull requests if desired.
You can use this url: https://github.com/apache/db-jdo.git[db-jdo.git]

To develop your own code to use JDO, you can use the links below
to download Apache JDO from one of the official ASF mirrors.
If you are using Maven, you can declare a dependency using the instructions below.

It is essential to xref:Verifying[verify the integrity] of the
distribution files after downloading any artifacts.

== Release Notesanchor:Release_Notes[]

release notes for JDO 3.1]

== APIanchor:API[]

The api project contains source to build jdo-api.jar, which defines the
JDO API. The jar file is the only artifact needed for users who wish to
compile their programs using the JDO API.

https://www.apache.org/dist/db/jdo/3.1/jdo-api-3.1-sources.jar.asc[asc]
https://www.apache.org/dist/db/jdo/3.1/jdo-api-3.1-sources.jar.sha1[sha1]
https://www.apache.org/dist/db/jdo/3.1/jdo-api-3.1-sources.jar.md5[md5]

=== Maven (convenience binary)anchor:Maven[]

The JDO API can be downloaded
automatically by maven and placed into the local maven repository if you
include the proper dependency in your maven project definition.
For example:
[source,xml]
<dependency>
  <groupId>javax.jdo</groupId>
  <artifactId>jdo-api</artifactId>
  <version>3.1</version>
</dependency>

== TCKanchor:TCK[]

This is a download for all implementors of JDO, and for those who want
to check how well an implementation is compliant with the JDO
specification.

The TCK project contains the JDO Technology Compatibility
Kit. The source distribution is the only artifact needed to be
downloaded by the user and contains all of the sources used to build
the JDO project including the API, TCK, and test artifacts.
The dependencies are automatically downloaded by
maven as needed to run the TCK. 

Please refer to the README for further details.

== Verifying Releasesanchor:Verifying_Releases[]

anchor:Verifying[]

It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files
using the PGP signature.

The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the
https://www.apache.org/dist/db/jdo/KEYS[KEYS] as well as the `asc`
signature file for the particular distribution. Make sure you get these
files from the https://www.apache.org/dist/db/jdo/[main distribution
directory], rather than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures using
these commands (depending on your tool set):

[source]
% pgpk -a KEYS 
% pgpv release_name.tar.gz.asc

[source]
% pgp -ka KEYS
% pgp release_name.tar.gz.asc

[source]
% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify release_name.tar.gz.asc
