release notes for JDO 3.1]

=== APIanchor:API[]

The api project contains source to build jdo-api.jar, which defines the
JDO API. The jar file is the only artifact needed for users who wish to
compile their programs using the JDO API. It can be downloaded
automatically by maven and placed into the local maven repository if you
include the proper dependency in your maven project definition. Use
groupId javax.jdo, artifactId jdo-api, version 3.1 and define your
remote repository as http://www.ibiblio.org/maven. Alternatively, it can
be downloaded manually and put into a location of your choice.

to check how well an implementation is compliant with the JDO
specification. The tck project contains the JDO Technology Compatibility
Kit. The source distribution is the only artifact needed to be
downloaded by the user. The dependencies are automatically downloaded by
maven as needed to run the TCK. Please refer to the README.html for
further details.

== Verifying Releasesanchor:Verifying_Releases[]

anchor:Verifying[]

It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files
using the PGP signature.

The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the
http://www.apache.org/dist/db/jdo/KEYS[KEYS] as well as the `asc`
signature file for the particular distribution. Make sure you get these
files from the http://www.apache.org/dist/db/jdo/[main distribution
directory], rather than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures using

` % pgpk -a KEYS % pgpv release_name.tar.gz.asc` _or_ +
` % pgp -ka KEYS % pgp release_name.tar.gz.asc` _or_ +
` % gpg --import KEYS % gpg --verify release_name.tar.gz.asc`
