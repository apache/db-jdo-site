== Meta-Data - JDOQueryanchor:Meta-Data_-_JDOQuery[]

JDO defines XML MetaData in *jdo* files as well as *orm* files, but also
specifies that named queries can be defined in _jdoquery_ files. As
always with XML, the metadata must match the defined DTD/XSD for that
file type. This section describes the content of the *jdoquery* files.
All *jdoquery* files must contain a valid DTD/DOCTYPE specification. You
can use PUBLIC or SYSTEM versions of these.

Here are a few examples valid for *jdoquery* files eith DTD
specification

....
<!DOCTYPE jdoquery PUBLIC
    "-//The Apache Software Foundation//DTD Java Data Objects Query Metadata 3.2//EN"
    "https://db.apache.org/jdo/xmlns/jdoquery_3_2.dtd">
....

or

....
<!DOCTYPE jdoquery SYSTEM "file:/javax/jdo/jdoquery.dtd">
....

{empty} +


Here is an example valid for *jdoquery* files with XSD specification

....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<jdoquery xmlns="https://db.apache.org/jdo/xmlns/jdoquery"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="https://db.apache.org/jdo/xmlns/jdoquery https://db.apache.org/jdo/xmlns/jdoquery_3_2.xsd" version="3.2">
    ...
</jdoquery>
....

Your MetaData should match either the
https://db.apache.org/jdo/xmlns/jdoquery_3_2.dtd[DTD] or the
https://db.apache.org/jdo/xmlns/jdoquery_3_2.xsd[XSD] specification.
