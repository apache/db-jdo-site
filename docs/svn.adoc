== Source Code Version Controlanchor:Source_Code_Version_Control[]

Apache JDO uses http://subversion.tigris.org[Subversion] to manage its
source code. If you're new to Subversion, you can check out the
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/[online book] about Subversion. Note that we
are currently using Subversion 1.1.x (there are separate versions of the
book covering 1.0 and 1.1).

To receive notice of commits to the repository subscribe to
jdo-commits@db.apache.org by sending email to
jdo-commits-subscribe@db.apache.org.

== Web Access to Subversionanchor:Web_Access_to_Subversion[]

If you just want to browse the source code, you can use the
https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/db/jdo[ViewVC web interface] to
Subversion. This is current at all times.

== Checking Out Code Using Subversionanchor:Checking_Out_Code_Using_Subversion[]

Anyone can check code out of Subversion. You only need to specify a
username and password to update the Subversion repository, and only JDO
committers can do that. If you are a committer, are working from behind
a firewall, or are connected to the internet through a proxy server,
please see the sections below for more information.

=== Anonymous check out from Subversionanchor:Anonymous_check_out_from_Subversion[]

Use a command like:

....
% svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/jdo 
....

Once you have Apache JDO checked out you can update the source by
executing the following command from within the jdo.

....
% svn update
....

=== Access from behind a firewallanchor:Access_from_behind_a_firewall[]

For those users who are stuck behind a corporate firewall which is
blocking http access to the Subversion repository, you can try to access
it via HTTPS:

....
% svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/jdo
....

=== Access through a proxyanchor:Access_through_a_proxy[]

The Subversion client can go through a proxy, if you configure it to do
so. First, edit your "servers" configuration file to indicate which
proxy to use. The files location depends on your operating system. On
Linux or Unix it is located in the directory "~/.subversion". On Windows
it is in "%APPDATA%\Subversion". (Try "echo %APPDATA%", note this is a
hidden directory.)

There are comments in the file explaining what to do. If you don't have
that file, get the latest Subversion client and run any command; this
will cause the configuration directory and template files to be created.

Example : Edit the 'servers' file and add something like :

....
[global]
http-proxy-host = your.proxy.name
http-proxy-port = 3128
....

Please use the regular http proxy settings in case you want to access
the the repository from the Sun network (SWAN).

=== Committer accessanchor:Committer_access[]

Everyone can access the Apache JDO Subversion repository via HTTPS, but
Apache JDO Committers must checkout the Subversion repository via HTTPS.

....
% svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/jdo
....

=== NetBeans CVS repository accessanchor:NetBeans_CVS_repository_access[]

The btree subproject checks out the NetBeans mdr btree implementation.
This requires cvs being installed on your system. The official NetBeans
cvs host might not work if you are behind a firewall that blocks the cvs
port. Please consult the
http://www.netbeans.org/community/sources[NetBeans sources] page for
more info.

If you do not have a cvs client installed on your system you can
download the NetBeans mdr btree sources
link:/jdo-data/attachments/SubversionRepository/attachments/netbeans-mdr-btree.zip[here].
Unzip the file in the btree directory and comment out (or remove) the
definition of the preGoal java:prepare-filesystem.

== Submitting Code Changesanchor:Submitting_Code_Changes[]

=== Submitting a patchanchor:Submitting_a_patch[]

If you make changes to Apache JDO, and would like to contribute the to
the project, you should create a patch and send it to the jdo-dev alias
jdo-dev@db.apache.org. To create a patch, simply execute the following
command:

....
% svn diff > your-changes.patch
....

=== Committing changes to subversionanchor:Committing_changes_to_subversion[]

To commit changes to the Subversion repository, you must be an Apache
JDO committer. See link:get-involved.html[Get Involved] for information
on how to become a committer and how to set up your password once you
become a committer.

Once your password is set, you can use a command like this to commit:

....
$> svn commit --username your-username
Authentication realm: <https://svn.apache.org:443> ASF Committers
Password for 'your-username': your-password
....

You can also pass your password on the command line directly, but this
is a security problem on multiuser unix computers (the command line
arguments are available via the ps command). Here is the command if you
are Windows or a single user unix computer:

....
$> svn commit --username your-username --password your-password
....

Remember to replace 'your-username' and 'your-password' with your actual
username and password on svn.apache.org.

== Building JDO from Sourceanchor:Building_JDO_from_Source[]

Refer to the http://wiki.apache.org/jdo/FrontPage[Wiki page] for
details. Note that the JDO project is subdivided into several smaller
projects, and each project is built separately.

== Using Subversion on Windows with cygwinanchor:Using_Subversion_on_Windows_with_cygwin[]

If you use Subversion on Windows under cygwin, you may find that the
Subversion client automatically assigns the executable property to
non-executable files. In that case, you would see this at the bottom of
an _svn diff_ of the file:

....
Property changes on: test/sql/derby/datastoreidentity/schema1.sql
___________________________________________________________________
Name: svn:executable
   + *
....

This section explains the source of the problem and suggests some
actions to avoid it.

=== Backgroundanchor:Background[]

Subversion carries executable information in the built-in property
called svn:executable. This property, unlike others, may be present or
absent, but it has no value. You can add it or delete it, but but you
cannot change its value.

In theory, Subversion ignores Windows file permissions and by default
does not set svn:executable. However, cygwin svn acts like Unix svn and
determines the svn:executable property based on file permissions.

If you create a file from the cygwin command line, by default it is
executable only if the filename ends with .bat, .com or .exe, or if its
content starts with #!. [This is what the doc says, but you may see -x
for all files.] If you create a file using a Windows tool, by default
its Windows permissions are executable by all. Cygwin interprets the
Unix-style permissions this way as well. If the file is executable by
all, cygwin svn sets the svn:executable property on the file when you
invoke _svn add_.

=== Removing existing executable properties from the repositoryanchor:Removing_existing_executable_properties_from_the_repository[]

You can use svn propdel to remove the svn:executable property from your
working copy.

....
    svn propdel -R svn:executable .
....

will recursively remove the svn:executable property from all of the
files below the current directory. You can use this and commit the files
to clean the repository if necessary.

=== Preventing Subversion from adding unwanted executable propertiesanchor:Preventing_Subversion_from_adding_unwanted_executable_properties[]

Windows/cygwin users who don't want to have to think about using _svn
propdel_ or _chmod_ on each added file can use a non-cygwin version of
svn. The Subversion 1.2.3 Win32 binaries, downloadable from the link at
the bottom of http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html, appear
to work well. After installation add the svn.exe location to your
Windows PATH variable. If you are switching from cygwin svn to Win32 svn

[arabic]
. Remove the subversion component from your cygwin installation because
when svn is invoked from a cygwin window, the cygwin version is found
even if your cygwin/bin directory is later on the path. (In the Select
Packages window of the setup wizard, navigate to the subversion package
in the Devel. category. Click on the status icon until Uninstall is
displayed. Click next and continue through the wizard until installation
is complete.)
. Copy the servers file and the auth folder from the sygwin
~/.subversion directory to C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application
Data\Subversion used by Win32 subversion.

Note that windows svn uses backslash as the path separator when
displaying file names. You cannot just copy and paste this file name to
another svn command when running from within a cygwin shell. You need to
enclose the file name into double quotes.

Alternatively, Windows users can set file permissions in Windows
Explorer. (Right-click on the top-level folder & select Properties.
Select the Security tab. Click Advanced. Remove all instances of Read &
Execute from the Permission Entries. Click "Reset permissions on all
child objects and enable propogations of inheritable permissions". Click
Apply. OK. OK.) You will have to do this again when you do a clean
checkout to a new directory.
